              Coding to live, and continue living to continue coding. That's how my life is going
              and I'm genuenely proud of that: to study and have a related job that I love and that
              I think has a potential to improvement such that I can influence it and maybe see
              unfold during my lifetime what I've carefully helped to develop.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like doing my best and at the end of the day either see that I got the job done or,
              while trying, that I got substantialy closer to piece the problem together. That's the
              programmer's job after all: to solve problems and to solve them efficiently enough
              given the deadline.
            </p>

              Programming languages, libraries, frameworks and what not are nothing more than tools
              which choice should be influenced by your ultimate need, given it had been thoroughly
              avalued at the time. I like to point that out because of how overwhelmed I am seeing
              people defend technologies like kids used to their favorite Pokémon. Of course, I have
              my opinions and preferences, but knowing when to put them aside when taking a decision
              is dificult, even more so to figure out you should do that in the first place. I do my
              best to realize that.
            </p>

              I love learning interesting things, so here's the things I'm confident about knowing
              given the proportional amount of experience I gathered. Plus, why I invested my time
              on them and what knowledge I was trying boost by doing so:

                  Gives me full control of my computer and all the software it runs, even if just as
                  a matter of choice. There is an awful lot of things to be learnt just by
                  configuring your system, even if from the ground up to the state you've alerady
                  been using for so long.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Encourage me to learn the structure of the operating system and how it works. In
                  this process you end up learning concepts and characteristics of operating systems
                  in general.

                  Great learning curve, quick to get something done at a fundamental level,
                  abstracted, metaclasses, official bindings to many technologies, many cli apps
                  written with it, better package manager than npm, less gibberish-y code compared
                  to javascript, alternative to javascript, slow but not because of

                  oficialy recommended formatting style, some level of acknowledgment of the
                  importance of static typing (type hints), easier extensibility with C (not that I
                  personally see an use for that, but that gets the attention of who does and would
                  to make it open-source) and great editor LSP support for both editing and
                  debugging.

                <h3>Javascript (client-side)</h3>
                <p>
                  Best way to code websites, official bindings to many technologies, many cli apps
                  written with it, many job possibilites on the parts of the industry with the most
                  contact with the average software user, extremelly straight forward
                  event-loop-based concurrency API, turns out HTML and CSS are (personally) the best
                  and most mature
                  <strong>purelly imperative</strong> ways of representing an UI's stucture as code,
                  turns out every desktop UI toolkit wants to have their own UI structuring
                  language/method so I might as well stick to HTML and CSS because Electron general
                  cost implication seems reasonable in comparison and one day a native UI toolkit
                  based on an arbitrary language that uses HTML and CSS may appear and it may be
                  actually good.

                <h3>Keyboard-driven workflow</h3>
                <p>
                  I've grown to love convenience, specifically efficiency-driven convenience, like
                  removing the need for a mouse in order do select and move stuff around my
                  computer. Vim is the best example of this. It doesn't have in any way a straight
                  forward learning curve, but the end result completely removes the mouse of the
                  equation, and although I do not expect to maintain an over 100wpm typing speed
                  during all my usage like the obssesive tryhards do, I have to admit that the
                  comfort and delight of not having to reach for a mouse and slowly aim it at a
                  button is completely worth it.

                  Terminals, tyling window managers, vim-inspired web browsers (I'm not kidding),
                  vim-motions-based file managers, vim motions extensions for other software, etc.
                  I'm definitely still a newbie in using Vim, but I'm invested on it 100%, and not
                  because its Vim (I tried Emacs, didn't like at all), but because It's just way
                  more comfortable to reach everything using only the keyboard and even reducing the
                  necessity to reach for modifier keys (ctrl, shift, alt or mod a.k.a. windows key).

            <h3>The Person</h3>
            <p><strong>I'm definitely not</strong> loud, smug, egotistic nor attention-seeking.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>I try my best to be</strong> honest, indiferent, reasonable and open-minded.
            </p>
            <p><strong>I am</strong> calm, patient and solution-driven.</p>
            <h3>Define yourself in a sentence</h3>
            <p>
              There's this line of dialog from House MD that never scaped my head from the moment I
              heard it. I can't state that it fully represents me, but
              <strong>I am stating</strong> that the type of person it describes is the type of
              person I professionaly and personally admire and strive to be. I like to be adequately
              recognized (neither under- nor overrated) for being intelligent and -- although not as
              much, but I'm always trying to -- wise.
