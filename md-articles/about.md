# I'm Marcos

I'm a Brazilian software developer coding out of pure passion. Studying theory sometimes sucks, but the feeling of knowiwng how to follow through the solution for a problem out of pure experience is the most rewarding and self-esteem-inducing feeling I know. Coding and understanding software is, in all seriousness, in my top 5 reasons for being happy. It thought me how hard work pays out.

I'm not inherently interested and invested on every programming topic, though. I deem something as **fun** if: it puzzles me or it is challenging and involves a subject/idea/concept I think is cool. Nonetheless, I understand that _some times you gotta do what you gotta do_, so I'm not intimidated by duty. I neither can control the will of the user nor of my higher ups, so there's no point on complaining and the sooner I do what I have to do, the closer I'll get to the next fun task. Also, the less things I'll have to worry about in between shifts.

I'm a pragmatic person, so the process of trying to do something, although with little knowledge, helps me understand the problem and grasp possible solutions much more easier. I often get an overview of the problem first, then try it with what I know, then, and if I struggling, try to fill the gaps in my knowledge with the respective relevant resources. If I find myself too lost, I take some time to study the resources patiently with all the attention I can give. If I, in the process of getting lost, end up too anxious, I take some minutes of break to clear my mind and then return to the resources. Of course, that's my **default** methodology. If there's a recommended framework for reaching a solution, I'll be pleased to implement it; maybe I'll learn it's better and implement its _betterness_ in my default methodology.

I'm very open minded, but some times I can get biased by emotions (who doesn't), so I also incentivize people to be honest with me and call me out on my bs. I'm more than willing to apologize and acknowledge holes in my arguments. If I have no idea of something or have too little confidence commenting about it, I won't, but if I do and realize or later learn I'm wrong, I'll stop trying to push it forward until I learn enough to quit my bs, or just stop it all together because I may be not willing to learn it, so nothing fairer -- and nothing easier -- than just shut up.
